    "To illustrate the feedforward step in a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), consider a BNN with an input layer denoted by the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ consisting of $m$ neurons, a hidden layer vector represented as $\\mathbf{z}$ with $n$ neurons, and an output layer vector $\\mathbf{y}$ . The architecture ensures that every neuron in the input layer is connected to every neuron in the hidden layer through a set of weights, resulting in a fully connected network with three layers. Consider the following image to visualize this architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"Images/bnn_ff.svg\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\"></center>\n",

    "\n",
    "For a BNN, weights and biases are not fixed values. Instead, each weight and bias  are associated with a mean and a variance, which are parameters of the Gaussian distribution from which they are sampled at each forward step. This introduces variability in the weights and biases, allowing BNNs to inherently model uncertainty. The reparameterization trick is employed to effectively sample the weight and bias values from their respective independent Gaussian distributions and to guarantee differentiability during the backpropagation step. To further elucidate, consider the weights and biases between the input and hidden layers:\n",

The terms $w_{ij}$ and $b_j$ are recognized as latent variables, allowing us to treat the weights and biases as independent variables sampled from specific distributions. In matrix notation, the weight matrix and bias vector connecting the layers $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{z}$ can be represented as:\n",

The primary challenge in Bayesian inference is computing the posterior distribution $p(\\mathbf{w}| \\mathbf{D})$, which involves the intractable integral over the marginal likelihood $p(\\mathbf{D})$. Variational inference tackles this by proposing a simpler, parametrized distribution $q(\\mathbf{w})$, the variational distribution, to approximate the true posterior.\n",

    "Using this multivariate Gaussian results in a more complex model that can potentially capture intricate correlations between weights, thereby improving the model's accuracy, especially in the context of variational inference.

This technique simplifies the optimization of the ELBO by allowing us to treat each variational distribution over the weights as an independent entity. In essence, the mean field approach decouples the elements of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma_w$, reducing it to a diagonal matrix where each diagonal entry represents a univariate Gaussian distribution corresponding to the variance of each individual weight in the matrix.
