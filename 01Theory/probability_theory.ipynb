    "Suppose we have a complete set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events $B_1, \\cdots, B_n$, meaning only one of these events can occur at a time, and their union covers the entire sample space. We can find the ordinary probability of event $A$ occurring using the total probability formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\sum_k P(A|B_k)P(B_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this, first let's better define the concept of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. Mutually exclusive events, as we see before, are events that cannot occur simultaneously. On the other hand, exhaustive events are events that, when considered together, cover the entire sample space $\\Omega$. When a set of events is both mutually exclusive and exhaustive, it means that they cover all possible outcomes without overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, consider the example of rolling a fair six-sided die. The sample space for this experiment is the set of outcomes $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. We can define the events as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event $A_1$: The die shows an odd number (outcomes: $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$)\n",
    "- Event $A_2$: The die shows an even number (outcomes: $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The events $A_1$ and $A_2$ are mutually exclusive, because no outcome can be both odd and even simultaneously, meaning the intersection of $A_1$ and $A_2$ is an empty set. Furthermore, these events are exhaustive, because together they cover the entire sample space (every possible outcome is either odd or even). Thus, the set {$A_1$, $A_2$} is both mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{proof}:$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $\\Omega$ as the sample space. If $B_1, \\cdots, B_n$ are all the possible mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. If their union covers the entire sample space, then:\n",
